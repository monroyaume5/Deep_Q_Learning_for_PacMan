# Deep_Q_Learning_for_PacMan

## Project Overview

In this project, a Reinforcement Learning Deep Q-Learning Model was developed and trained to play the PacMan game. The implementation builds upon the codebase from the [CS 188 Spring 2024 course at UC Berkeley](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp24/projects/proj6/).

## Running the Code

To run the PacMan Deep Q-Learning Model, use the following command:

```bash
python pacman.py -p PacmanDeepQAgent -x 6000 -n 6010 -l smallGrid
